# Zapp

Zapp is a comically-named tool for making Python [zipapps](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441/).

Zipapps or zapps as we call them (hence the raygun theme) are packagings of Python programs into zip files. It's
comparable to [Pex](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/), [Subpar](https://github.com/google/subpar/) and
[Shiv](https://github.com/linkedin/shiv/) in intent, but shares the most with Subpar in particulars as like subpar Zapp
is designed for use with Bazel (and is co-developed with appropriate Bazel build rules).

## A quick overview of zipapps

A Python zipapp is a file with two parts - a "plain" text file with a "shebang" specifying a Python interpreter, followed by a ZIP formatted archive after the newline.
This is (for better or worse) a valid ZIP format archive, as the specification does not preclude prepended data.

When Python encounters a zipapp, it assumes you meant `PYTHONPATH=your.zip <shebang> -m __main__`.
See [the upstream docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html#the-python-zip-application-archive-format).
So not only must `zapp` generate a prefix script, it needs to insert a `__main__.py` that'll to your application.

## A quick overview of zapp

Zapp is really two artifacts - `zapp.bzl` which defines `rules_python` (`zapp_binary`, `zapp_test`) macros and implementations.
These Bazel macros work together with the `zappc` "compiler" to make producing zapps from Bazel convenient.

## A demo

So let's give zapp a spin

``` shellsession
$ cd examples
$ cat WORKSPACE
workspace(
    name = "zapp_examples",
)

# ...

git_repository(
    name = "rules_zapp",
    remote = "https://github.com/arrdem/rules_zapp.git",
    tag = "0.1.2",
)

$ cat BUILD
load("@rules_zapp//zapp:zapp.bzl",
     "zapp_binary",
)

# ...

zapp_binary(
    name = "hello_deps",
    main = "hello.py",
    deps = [
        py_requirement("pyyaml"),
    ]
)

```

In this directory there's a couple of `hello_*` targets that are variously zapped. This one uses an external dependency via `rules_python`'s `py_requirement` machinery.

Let's try `bazel build :hello_deps` to see how it gets zapped.

``` shellsession
$ bazel build :hello_deps
INFO: Analyzed target //:hello_deps (21 packages loaded, 74 targets configured).
INFO: Found 1 target...

              'zip_safe': True},
 'opts': {'debug': True,

```

Here, I've got the `zapp` compiler configured to debug what it's doing.
This is a bit unusual, but it's convenient for peeking under the hood.

The manifest which `zapp` consumes describes the relocation of files (and wheels, more on that in a bit) from the Bazel source tree per python `import = [...]` specifiers to locations in the container/logical filesystem within the zip archive.

We can see that the actual `hello.py` file (known as `projects/zapp/hello.py` within the repo) is being mapped into the zip archive without relocation.

We can also see that a `PyYAML` wheel is marked for inclusion in the archive.

If we run the produced zipapp -

``` shellsession
$ bazel run :hello_deps

Target //projects/zapp/example:hello_deps up-to-date:

hello, world!
I have YAML! and nothing to do with it. /home/arrdem/.cache/zapp/wheels/PyYAML-5.4.1-cp39-cp39-manylinux1_x86_64.whl/yaml/__init__.py
```

Here we can see that zapp when executed unpacked the wheel into a cache, inserted that cached wheel into the `sys.path`, and correctly delegated to our `hello.py` script, which was able to `import yaml` from the packaged wheel! ðŸŽ‰
